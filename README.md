### Author's Note
This About Me project has been a semester long assignment that over time has taught me a lot about the work that goes into being an effective web page designer. That's not all it has shown me however. This semester I have been going through some difficulty with stabalizing my mental health. About half way through I was diagnosed as being bipolar by multiple professionals. I was constantly stuggling with depression as well as insomnia. It was hard for me to accept at first, now realising the struggles that I grew up with mentally and had hoped to outgrow could be with me for the long haul. I felt mixes of anger and resentment toward myself, feeling like if I could just be like everyone else that my life would be much easier, cursing myself for my problems. This About Me project made it easier for me however. Twice a week my class was assigned work to do on our individual About Me projects, which included tasks such as sharing photos of our assets in life and embracing the visuals of our websites as a creative outlet. For me, those two days a week were a nice change. Through all the anger I was having internally towards myself, those two days a week were days where my professor encouraged us to push ourselves and reflect on the positive aspects of our lives. No matter what I was going through during the week, the About Me project was a time to think about the things that are going well and have gone well, and even though the pain would still linger, it made me feel more optimistic about the future. I wasn't always the best student and my moods would cause me to avoid my responsibilities and occasionally miss class, but when I was having trouble my professor, Steve Caruso, would always do his best to help me in a calm, collective, and friendly way, never showing malice towards for my inability to own my responsibilities or my stuggles to attend every class. Having a professor like that really made a huge impact for a student like me. It helped me look past the anxiety of school and feel more accepted in the classroom, even with my learning dissabilities and struggle with my mental health. I started falling behind when we had our midterm and struggled to catch up to the pace of the class, but even when I was assignments behind, Professor Caruso was happy to help me get back on track, regardless of where I currently was in the project. I am truelly thankful to have had the opportunity to be one of Professor Caruso's students this semester and it's sad to know that if I pass Web Page Development this semester that I may not have him as my professor again, but either way I'm greatful to have had such an understanding professor with immense passion for his student's success in a time where I couldn't be my own source of optimism. Thankyou for a great semester!

## What I've Learned
My class was taught a whole lot about web page development and design this semester. Some assignments were easier than others, but every lesson addressed key fundamentals of being an effective web page developer. Some things I learned this semester are...

How to program using HTML such as...
    Making headings, headers, and heads.
    Inserting images.
    Adding body text and ordered/unordered lists.
    Implimenting multiple files into one project and having them effect each other properly.
    Assigning ID tags.
    Creating contact forms.
    Implementing button selectors and drop down menus.
    **And _most importantly_ where to get bulk nonsense text online**

How to program in CSS, such as...
    Changing text color and background color.
    Adding borders, padding, margins and text alignment/decorations.
    Scaling webpages to fit a variety of screen sizes.
    Manipulating text and images using floats and drop caps.
    Implementing animations, transitions, rotations, and translation.
    Making use of flex boxes as well as the different directions and ways they can be displayed.
    Adding hover and text color changing effects.

## Color Scheme
The colors I used in my About Me project are:
    #4DF078 (for the green areas)
    #F0292E (for the red areas)
    #1DA1F0 (for the blue areas)
    #F0A541 (for the orange areas)
    rgb(0,0,0) or black (for the black areas)
    rgb(255,255,255) or white (for the white areas)
    #333 (for the grey areas)

Though some of these colors (#333) I used based off the recommendation of the class's online video tutorials, the reason I used these colors is to make my website standout with bright vibrant colors while remaining effective for viewers with vidual impairments. To start, Professor Caruso advised us to use Adobe's Color Wheel to find five colors that would not conflict with eachother from the view of someone with a visual impairment. This is where I got my red, blue, green, and red color choices from. I like how the red text looks when used over a green background. I also utilized the orange and blue to make areas stand out from the red and green colored majority.

To make my website easier to navigate, I added a navbar which allows users to click on the name of a given section and have the website bring them directly to that area. I used some hover effects to make the navbar more visually appealing, as well as giving the user a better view of which option they are about to click. The navbar is like a table of contents for my website. The navbar has four items: "Bio", "Gallery", "Blog", and "Contact Me".
