            <p>

                It was a frigid winter night when Russell was born. Forged in the freezing grasp of his environment, the flame in his heart burned bright enough to evolve him. A pheonix born from the ashes of his ancestors. A ghost of the living.

            </p>

            <p>

                Upon his arrival in the Great Land, Russell was greeted by french speaking dodo birds and mandorine capable mammals. The sky was green like a swamp, but the air was fragrant like a candle. Peace peace.
