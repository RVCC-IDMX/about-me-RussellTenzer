            <p>

                It was a frigid winter night when Russell was born. Forged in the freezing grasp of his environment, the flame in his heart burned bright enough to evolve him. A pheonix born from the ashes of his ancestors. A ghost of the living.

            </p>

            <p>

                Upon his arrival in the Great Land, Russell was greeted by french speaking dodo birds and mandorine capable mammals. The sky was green like a swamp, but the air was fragrant like a candle. Peace peace.

            </p>

            <p>
                My name is Russell Tenzer. I am a student at Raritan Valley Community College. In my free time I like to write lyrics, play video games, and paint shoes. I like to make others laugh and smile every chance I get and my goal is to make others happier than I've been sad. I hope to one day make a career for myself entertaining others, whether it be through writing music, live streaming, or making videos.
            </p>

            <p>
                In life I've realised that everything is not always going to go the way you wanted it to, but sometimes when life breaks your down, you're able to look at the pieces of you that remain and see what you're really made of. I've always had trouble staying optimistic. My dyslexia and ADHD have always made school difficult for me and my bipolar depression has made my personal life difficult at times as well, but that does't mean that they are a reason to give up. The things most worth gaining in life are often hard to obtain, which is why they mean so much once we've obtained them. Life is short to some and long to others, it all depends on how you look at it. Though I don't always succeed with it, I try to be better than the me I was yesterday everyday. It's all about perspective. If you see life as an unfair game, you won't want to participate, and if you don't participate, you'll never know what it feels like to be truly alive. No one has all the answers to everything, but the more you search, the more you'll find. I don't really know where I'm going with this but I guess it's that you should do your best to be your best, and that all anyone can really ask of you... that's all you can really ask of yourself. Keep your head up and your feet on the ground and just keep pushing forward. I promise you that it will be worth it in the long run.

                <h4>The Life of Samual Johnson</h4>
                
                <div>

                    <p>Of John Wesley, he said, 'He can talk well on any subject.' BOSWELL. 'Pray, Sir, what has he made of his story of a ghost?' JOHNSON. 'Why, Sir, he believes it; but not on sufficient authority. He did not take time enough to examine the girl. It was at Newcastle, where the ghost was said to have appeared to a young woman several times, mentioning something about the right to an old house, advising application to be made to an attorney, which was done; and, at the same time, saying the attorneys would do nothing, which proved to be the fact. "This (says John,) is a proof that a ghost knows our thoughts." Now (laughing,) it is not necessary to know our thoughts, to tell that an attorney will sometimes do nothing. Charles Wesley, who is a more stationary man, does not believe the story. I am sorry that John did not take more pains to inquire into the evidence for it.' MISS SEWARD, (with an incredulous smile,) 'What, Sir! about a ghost?' JOHNSON. (with solemn vehemence,) 'Yes, Madam: this is a question which, after five thousand years, is yet undecided; a question, whether in theology or philosophy, one of the most important that can come before the human understanding.'</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Knowles mentioned, as a proselyte to Quakerism, Miss ------, a young lady well known to Dr. Johnson, for whom he had shewn much affection; while she ever had, and still retained, a great respect for him. Mrs. Knowles at the same time took an opportunity of letting him know 'that the amiable young creature was sorry at finding that he was offended at her leaving the Church of England and embracing a simpler faith;' and, in the gentlest and most persuasive manner, solicited his kind indulgence for what was sincerely a matter of conscience. JOHNSON. (frowning very angrily,) 'Madam, she is an odious wench. She could not have any proper conviction that it was her duty to change her religion, which is the most important of all subjects, and should be studied with all care, and with all the helps we can get. She knew no more of the Church which she left, and that which she embraced, than she did of the difference between the Copernican and Ptolemaick systems.' MRS. KNOWLES. 'She had the New Testament before her.' JOHNSON. 'Madam, she could not understand the New Testament, the most difficult book in the world, for which the study of a life is required.' MRS. KNOWLES. 'It is clear as to essentials.' JOHNSON. 'But not as to controversial points. The heathens were easily converted, because they had nothing to give up; but we ought not, without very strong conviction indeed, to desert the religion in which we have been educated. That is the religion given you, the religion in which it may be said Providence has placed you. If you live conscientiously in that religion, you may be safe. But errour is dangerous indeed, if you err when you choose a religion for yourself.' MRS. KNOWLES. 'Must we then go by implicit faith?' JOHNSON. 'Why, Madam, the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith; and as to religion, have we heard all that a disciple of Confucius, all that a Mahometan, can say for himself?' He then rose again into passion, and attacked the young proselyte in the severest terms of reproach, so that both the ladies seemed to be much shocked.</p>
